# RADAR-SIMULATIONS

A model to simulate Radar Signals on MATLAB. The concepts covered are:
1. Generation of RADAR signals
2. Detection of Radar signals

## Radar Signals:
The Radar signals are broadly classified as Primary and Secondary Radars.
The Primary Radar Signals have 2 important classifications. They are:
- Continuous Waves : LFM, NLFM
- Pulsed Waves 

The LFM(Linear Frequency Modulation) Signals would include signals like sawtooth or triangle. The NLFM(Non-Linear Frequency Modulation) includes signals like sinusodials, Psuedorandoms, Noise etc.

## Experiment
This expertimantal trial covers topics like -
* Generation of Continuous LFM Waves like - Sine, Chirp
* Generation of Pulsed Waves - Rectangular Pulse, Sine Pulse Train
* Analysis of Power Spectral Density for the same
* Meeting general industry standard frequency standards
* Detection of Continuous Sine Wave, Analyse the frequency, sampling frequency, Strength of the signal
